The Product Category Application is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Java and Spring Boot. It allows users to manage products and categories through RESTful API endpoints. Users can perform various operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting products and categories.

The application provides endpoints for managing both products and categories separately. For products, users can create new products, retrieve products by ID, retrieve all products, update existing products, and delete products. Similarly, for categories, users can create new categories, retrieve all categories with pagination support, retrieve categories by ID, update existing categories, and delete categories.

This application is useful for businesses or developers who need a simple yet effective way to manage product and category data. It provides a straightforward API interface for interacting with product and category information, making it easy to integrate with other systems or use as a standalone service.
